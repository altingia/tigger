## Tigger: An experiment in Hybrid programming for Phylogenetics

[TIGER][tiger] stands for "Tree Independent Generation of Evolutionary Rates". The algorithm was developed by Carla A. Cummins and James O. McInerney, and the original implementation is in python, available [here][tiger]. The related paper can be found [here][paper].

A faster version called [FAST_tiger][fast_tiger] was subsequently developed in C++, by Paul Frandsen and Christof Mayer. It was developed to be used in the PartitionFinder Software, specifically to implement automatic partitioning using a kmeans algorithm on the rates generated by TIGER. That paper can be found [here][kmeans].

This implementation is call a mix of python and [cython][cython]. It aims to get the speed of C++ whilst developing in python. So there is less code, it is easier to read and maintain, but it still runs FAST. It is called tigger, a character from A.A Milne's Winnie the Pooh. Tigger is like a tiger, except cuter and bouncier. It was developed by Brett Calcott, Paul Frandsen, and Rob Lanfear.

This isn't production code yet, as it is not portable, hasn't been properly tested, and is not feature complete...
